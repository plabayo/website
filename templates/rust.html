        <h2>Training</h2>

        <p>
            We have a strong background in C/C++ and over a decade of experience
            in using and teaching Rust. Our team is dedicated to helping you and
            your team succeed in your Rust development journey. As the authors
            of
            <a href="https://rust-lang.guide/">rust-lang.guide</a>, a free guide
            to becoming a Rust developer, we have the expertise to guide you
            through the process.
        </p>

        <p>
            We offer remote training services that can be delivered
            asynchronously or interactively via video and/or text. Our team is
            based in Belgium, which allows us to accommodate clients across
            different time zones. We are available during morning hours for
            American clients, office hours for European and African clients, and
            evening hours for Asian clients.
        </p>

        <h2>Development</h2>

        <p>
            At Plabayo, we are developers at heart and we practice what we
            preach. While we often work on private codebases for our clients, we
            also develop and maintain our own open-source codebases.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our main focus is
            <a href="https://ramaproxy.org">Rama</a> (ラマ), an
            open-source Rust project that we spend most of our time on. Rama is
            a powerful modular service framework designed specifically for the
            Rust language. Its primary focus is to develop proxies, but its
            versatile nature allows it to excel in developing web services and
            clients as well. In fact,
            <a href="https://github.com/plabayo/website"
                >this website is served by Rama</a
            >.
        </p>

        <p>
            With Rama, you can move and transform your network packets with
            ease. Its modular design allows for flexible customization, making
            it an ideal solution for a wide range of network-related tasks.
            Whether you need to develop proxies, web services, or clients, Rama
            is an excellent choice.
