        <h2>ラマ</h2>

        <p>
            Our main open source focus is
            <a href="https://ramaproxy.org">Rama</a> (ラマ), a Rust
            project that we spend most of our time on. Rama is a powerful
            modular service framework designed specifically for the Rust
            language. Its primary focus is to develop proxies, but its versatile
            nature allows it to excel in developing web services and clients as
            well. In fact,
            <a href="https://github.com/plabayo/website"
                >this website is served by Rama</a
            >.
        </p>

        <p>
            With Rama, you can move and transform your network packets with
            ease. Its modular design allows for flexible customization, making
            it an ideal solution for a wide range of network-related tasks.
            Whether you need to develop proxies, web services, or clients, Rama
            is an excellent choice.

            process and the benefits of using Rama to develop proxy services.

        <h2>Rust Crates</h2>

        <p>
            Besides Rama we have a couple of more Rust crates that we develop
            and maintain:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/plabayo/tokio-graceful">
                    <code>tokio-graceful</code> </a
                >: Graceful shutdown util for Rust projects using the Tokio
                Async runtime.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/plabayo/venndb">
                    <code>venndb</code> </a
                >: in memory Rust database to query your data like a Venn
                diagram .
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            At our team, we're passionate about Rust and its ecosystem. That's
            why we're proud to contribute to all kinds of Rust crates, pushing
            fixes upstream, proposing and developing features, reviewing PRs,
            and helping community members online.
        </p>

        <p>
            By working together with and for the Rust ecosystem, we're able to
            help ensure that Rust remains a reliable and secure language for
            years to come. Our team has the expertise and experience needed to
            provide a wide range of Rust-related services, including team
            training, code auditing, codebase refactoring, and project
            development.
